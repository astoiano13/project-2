Description
You awaken in a stone labyrinth, with no memory of how you got there. Armed with nothing but a sword as well as one memory “To get to the castle in the center of town before it’s too late”. 
Will you be able to get to the castle in time with the help of your fellow party members? Will you remember who you are? 

User Story 
As a lover of the fantasy genre as well as classic text games, 
I want to be able to play a game that envelops these categories, 
So that I can be entertained.
